# RFSwitchLibrary

This is a C# DLL for turning on/off the output/input of RF/analog devices.

It does so by controlling the voltage of each pin of FTDI USB interface. 
<br>The pins of the FTDI USB interface are wired to the paths of an RF switch that is used to turn on/off the output/input of the RF/analog devices. 
<br>By controlling the pin voltages, we can turn on/off any combination of RF switch paths, which means we can turn on/off any ports of the RF/analog devices.
